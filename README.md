## 📝 About

eBook‑Shelf is a minimal web application for showcasing a collection of eBooks. The frontend is built using React (via Vite), and it fetches data from a backend API powered by Express.js. The goal is to have a clean separation between client and server, making it easier to extend (e.g. add CRUD, authentication, etc.).

---

## ✨ Features

- Display a list of books with title, author, and (optionally) other metadata  
- Basic API endpoint(s) to fetch book data  
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests  
- React-based UI for easy expansion  
- Modular architecture (frontend + backend separation)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You should have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm (comes with Node.js)  
- (Optionally) `yarn`, if you prefer it over npm  

### Setup & Run

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sufyanism/eBook-Shelf.git
   cd eBook-Shelf
   ```

2. Setup the **backend**  
   ```bash
   cd src/backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Express server (e.g. on `http://localhost:5000`).

3. Setup the **frontend**  
   In a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   cd src/frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will run the React app (e.g. on `http://localhost:5173` or some similar port).

4. Open your browser to the React app’s URL. The frontend should fetch data from the backend and display the list of eBooks.

## 🗂 Project Structure

```
eBook-Shelf/
├── src/
│   ├── backend/           # Express server code
│   │   ├── server.js       # Entry point for backend
│   │   └── …               # Other backend modules, routes, etc.
│   └── frontend/          # React (Vite) application
│       ├── src/            # React components, pages, etc.
│       └── …               
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

You can extend this structure over time (e.g. adding `routes/`, `controllers/`, `models/`, etc. in backend; `components/`, `pages/`, `services/` in frontend).

## 🔌 API Endpoints

Here are some of the key backend endpoints:

| Method | Path            | Description                          |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/books`     | Fetches the list of all books        |
| GET    | `/`              | Basic health check (returns a message) |

You can further expand with endpoints for **create**, **update**, **delete** (CRUD) as needed, e.g. `POST /api/books`, `PUT /api/books/:id`, etc.
